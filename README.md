# Film Revenue Prediction

## Introduction

This project focuses on predicting the revenue of films using Machine Learning techniques. By analyzing various features of films, such as genre, studio, and audience engagement metrics, we aim to provide accurate revenue estimates.

## Implementation and Technology Used

The project is implemented using Python in Jupyter Notebooks. We rely on the following technologies and libraries:

- **Data Preprocessing**: We use pandas for data manipulation and preprocessing tasks, including handling missing values and transforming categorical variables into numerical representations.

- **Modeling**: For implementing machine learning models, we primarily use scikit-learn. Models include linear regression, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest Regressor, and Support Vector Regressor.

- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is employed to address the curse of dimensionality, particularly focusing on embeddings.

- **Outlier Management**: Outliers are managed through visual analysis and filtering based on key features.

- **Visualization**: Matplotlib is utilized for visualizing data distributions, model performance metrics, and other relevant insights.

- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebooks provide an interactive environment for code development, experimentation, and documentation, ensuring a transparent and reproducible workflow.

## Conclusion

After extensive experimentation and evaluation, the Random Forest Regressor emerges as the most suitable model for revenue prediction. Its ability to handle complex relationships between features and robust performance across different scenarios make it the preferred choice for accurate revenue estimations in this context.
